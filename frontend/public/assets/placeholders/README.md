Placeholder assets for Aira frontend UI

This folder contains temporary placeholder files used by the UI while real design assets are not yet provided. Replace or remove these files when you add the real images (SVG/PNG) and update references in the app.

Files:

- logo.txt - placeholder for app logo
- background_light.txt - placeholder for light background
- background_dark.txt - placeholder for dark background
- btn_slide.txt - placeholder for slide (sidebar) button asset
- btn_search.txt - placeholder for search button asset
- btn_history.txt - placeholder for history button asset
- btn_settings.txt - placeholder for settings button asset

You can keep these as text files for now or replace them with actual image files (e.g., logo.svg).
